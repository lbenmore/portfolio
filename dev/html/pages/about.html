  	<p> Hello, friend.</p>
    <p>My name is Lisa Benmore and I'm currently living and working in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
    <p>I began my journey into code back in 2009 when I began going to The Art Institute of California - Los Angeles. I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor's of Science in Web Design and Interactive Media.</p>
    <p>From there, I started my journey at Xaxis and have been there since where I'm currently the Developer Tech Lead for their in-house creative team, AdLabs. My work has included pixel-perfect translation of mocks into working executions, utilizing partner platforms' APIs in order to personalize ad experiences, the creation and maintenance of multiple web platforms used across various teams within the organization, and create and train on code, structure, and setup best practices.</p>
    <p>When not programming, I enjoy spending time with my little doggo, reading sci-fi and fantasy, and forays into arts and crafts. I also watch way too much television (did you catch that reference before?).</p>
