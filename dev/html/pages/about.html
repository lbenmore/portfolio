      Hello, friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      My name is Lisa Benmore and I'm currently living and working in Los Angeles, CA.
    </p>
    <p>
      I began my journey into code back in 2009 when I began going to The Art Institute of California - Los Angeles. I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor's of Science in Web Design and Interactive Media.
    </p>
    <p>
      From there, I started my journey at Xaxis where I had been the Developer Tech Lead for their in-house creative team, AdLabs. My work included pixel-perfect translation of mocks into working executions, utilizing partner platforms' APIs in order to personalize ad experiences, the creation and maintenance of multiple web platforms used across various teams within the organization, and the creation and training of code templates, structure, and setup best practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      After five years at Xaxis, I moved on to the Ad Server team at GumGum where I am currently a JavaScript Engineer working to maintain the codebase that renders their ad executions for publishers' pages.

      When not programming, I enjoy spending time with my little doggo, reading sci-fi and fantasy, and forays into arts and crafts. I also watch way too much television.
