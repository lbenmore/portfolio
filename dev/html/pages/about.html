  	<p> Hello, friend.</p>
    <p>My name is Lisa Benmore and I'm currently living and working in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
    <p>I began my journey into code back in 2009 when I began going to The Art Institute of California - Los Angeles. I graduated in 2014 with a Bachelor's of Science in Web Design and Interactive Media.</p>
    <p>From there, I began working at Xaxis - a media buying company - on their in-house creative team called AdLabs.</p>
    <p>My initial role as Interactive Developer involved making ads that had been made with Adobe Flash into HTML5-friendly experiences using CSS and JavaScript. I also built out new banners, including dynamic ads using our partners' APIs to utilize customized data.</p>
    <p>After becoming Senior Developer, I began training new developers on the team using templates I'd created that could be reused. I also included a library I had written that is still used in most of our campaigns.</p>
    <p>Most recently, I have been the Lead Developer for the team, managing how we set up our files, conventions for how we code, and processes within the platforms we use. I also manage our partnerships with those platforms.</p>
    <p>Aside from the campaign work that deals with our banner ads, the team has also been responsible for building out utilities and platforms that are used or will be used by many teams within Xaxis (and possibly beyond). I am currently the sole developer for these tools/platforms and have written the majority of functionality.</p>
    <p>When not programming, I enjoy spending time with my little doggo, reading sci-fi and fantasy, and forays into arts and crafts. I also watch way too much television (did you catch that reference before?).</p>

    <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

    <p>Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you, I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me. Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to hand it over to your dumb ass. </p>

    <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb. </p>

    <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>

    <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. </p>

    <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand? </p>

    <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>
