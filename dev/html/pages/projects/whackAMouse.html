      Welcome to Whack-a-Mouse! If you're on a desktop, go ahead and click the
      little guys as they appear to knock them back down into their burrows.
      If you're on mobile, a satisfying tap to the head should do the trick.
      The speed at which they pop up will increase with every five that are
      successfully knocked down. See how long you can last before they get
      angry!

      Whack-a-Mouse is written using ES6 and utilizes Classes. The artwork
      is unfortunately done by myself which is why Whack-a-Mole turned into
      Whack-a-Mouse. This was unfortunately my best attempt at drawing a mole.
