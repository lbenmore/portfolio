      Here's a few examples of infinite carousels. They are each configured to
      handle an infinite amount of items. The single item carousel is built in
      ES6 as a Class. The three-item carousel is written in JavaScript to be
      compatible with as many legacy browsers as possible (I'm looking at you,
      IE).
