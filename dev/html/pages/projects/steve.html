      Hey, Steve! Steve is the dinosaur that lives where there is no internet,
      according to Google. This is my recreation of the basic functionality of
      the game. If you're on desktop, hit the spacebar to jump over the cacti
      as they get close to Steve. If you're on a mobile device, tap the screen
      when you need to jump. But watch out, the cacti will increase speed after
      every five that you successfully jump over!

      Steve was written using ES6 and utilizes Classes as well as the
      RequestAnimationFrame API for animation.
