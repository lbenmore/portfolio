      Scroll down to see the scroll-based animations. In the last
      section, there's a fun and in no way copyrighted game made up of
      blocks of various shapes and sizes. Fit them together to try
      to form rows. When a row is full, it'll disappear. If the
      blocks make it to the top, game over! Use the left and right
      arrows on the keyboard to move the pieces and the shift key to
      rotate them. Enjoy!
