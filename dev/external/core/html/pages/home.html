      Bnmr Core is a framework built on top of the <a href='//lisabenmore.com/bnmr/documentation.html' target='_blank'>Bnmr Library</a> and can be used as the basis for small-scale web sites and web applications.
      It uses a <code>config.json</code> file similar to many popular frameworks.
      Use this file to set up your pages with paths to their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and assign their navigation.

      There are some great functions built in with aliases in the Bnmr Library to help make development fast and easy.
      For example, use <code>$$.go(pageName)</code> and pass the string value of a page set up in the config file to navigate.
      To start, use <code>$$.onload(loadFunction)</code> and pass the function to execute on the completed load of Bnmr Core and all assets listed in the configuration file.
      The <code>$$.nav()</code> function returns the navigation items for a given page.
      It can also be replicated to pass different property names to collect subnavigation, tertiary navigation, to-infinity-navigation, and all navigation.

      In this demo site, you can also find examples of components that have been built for use with the Bnmr Library and work well within a project using Bnmr Core - like this one!
